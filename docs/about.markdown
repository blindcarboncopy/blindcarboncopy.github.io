This site is intended to serve as documentation, foremost for myself. My goals as a hobbyist involve narrow-scope solutions to small-scale/home manufacturing. My hope is that any reader will feel able and compelled to reproduce the projects I've documented here, whether whole, piecemeal, or in distanced imitation.

This site was created with Jekyll and the minima theme:
