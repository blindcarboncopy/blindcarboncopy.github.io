This is a \[post/blog/site/test\]. My original intent for this site was a portfolio of my design and fabrication projects, as well as some miscellaneous blog posts explicating odd practices or discoveries. But essentially, this is a hobby blog, now and forever. Posts and projects will vary in subject and scope, and any cohesion between them will be an accident more often than not.

My own expectations are still up in the air. In 2012, during the brief time that this site was home to my wordpress blog, I wrote exclusively about musical theater. One of the only three posts I made included wordy, superficial reviews of both _Cabaret_ and _Spamalot_, which I had seen in a single weekend with my family. Through the entire lifespan of that blog, if you had asked about my hobbies, I would never have thought to broach theater as one of them. What I _would_ have mentioned: Woodworking, coding, playing music, anything I could cram under the umbrella of _creating_. Now, all this to say, while I sincerely expect I'll write a fair few posts that would appeal to some strictly hypothetical creatives who, strictly hypothetically, managed to stumble upon this SEO-oblivious blog, I don't really intend or promise that will be the case.

Anyway, that's post \#1. Now I'm gonna see about figuring out how to properly leverage front matter, and peruse some Jekyll theme demos.

Until the next recurrence.
